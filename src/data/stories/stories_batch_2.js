    title: "Jacob's Ladder",
    icon: "⚡",
    era: "Patriarchs",
    summary: "Fleeing from Esau, Jacob stopped for the night and used a stone for a pillow. He dreamed of a stairway resting on earth with its top reaching to heaven, and angels ascending and descending on it. Above it stood the Lord, who confirmed the covenant made to Abraham and Isaac, promising the land to Jacob and his descendants. God promised, 'I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go.' When Jacob awoke, he said, 'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.' He called the place Bethel, meaning 'house of God,' and made a vow to serve the Lord.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Genesis 28:12-13", text: "And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac." },
      { ref: "Genesis 28:15", text: "And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did Jacob see in his dream?", options: ["A ladder to heaven", "An angel", "A burning bush", "A flood"], correct: 0, ref: "Genesis 28:12" },
      { q: "What was on the ladder?", options: ["Angels ascending and descending", "Stars", "People climbing", "Nothing"], correct: 0, ref: "Genesis 28:12" },
      { q: "What did Jacob name the place?", options: ["Bethany", "Bethel", "Jerusalem", "Canaan"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 28:19" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Jacob's ladder vision reveals God's faithfulness to pursue us even when we run. Despite Jacob's deception, God appeared to him and renewed His covenant promises. Jesus referenced this event in John 1:51, identifying Himself as the true ladder connecting heaven and earth."

    title: "Joseph's Dreams",
    icon: "🦁",
    era: "Patriarchs",
    summary: "Jacob loved Joseph more than his other sons and made him a richly ornamented robe. Joseph's brothers hated him for this and because of his dreams. Joseph dreamed that his brothers' sheaves of grain bowed down to his sheaf, and later that the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to him. One day, when Joseph came to check on his brothers, they plotted to kill him. Reuben convinced them to throw Joseph into a cistern instead. Later, they sold him to Midianite merchants for twenty shekels of silver who took Joseph to Egypt.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Genesis 37:3-4", text: "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him." },
      { ref: "Genesis 37:28", text: "Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did Jacob give Joseph that made his brothers jealous?", options: ["Gold", "A coat of many colors", "Land", "Sheep"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 37:3" },
      { q: "How much did Joseph's brothers sell him for?", options: ["10 shekels", "20 shekels", "30 shekels", "50 shekels"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 37:28" },
      { q: "Where was Joseph taken?", options: ["Babylon", "Canaan", "Egypt", "Rome"], correct: 2, ref: "Genesis 37:28" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Joseph's story is one of the most complete pictures of Christ in the Old Testament. Like Jesus, he was loved by his father, hated by his brothers, sold for silver, and ultimately became a savior. God's sovereignty is evident - what Joseph's brothers meant for evil, God meant for good (Genesis 50:20)."

    id: 13,
    title: "Joseph in Egypt",
    icon: "🐋",
    era: "Patriarchs",
    summary: "In Egypt, Joseph served Potiphar faithfully. Potiphar's wife tried to seduce Joseph, but he refused and fled. She falsely accused him, and Joseph was thrown into prison. Even there, God was with Joseph. He interpreted dreams for Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker. Two years later, Pharaoh had troubling dreams. Joseph was brought before Pharaoh and interpreted them: seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh made Joseph second-in-command over Egypt to prepare for the famine.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Genesis 39:9", text: "There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" },
      { ref: "Genesis 41:39-40", text: "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Who falsely accused Joseph?", options: ["Pharaoh", "Potiphar's wife", "His brothers", "The cupbearer"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 39:14-18" },
      { q: "What were Pharaoh's dreams about?", options: ["War", "Feast and famine", "Death", "A journey"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 41:1-7" },
      { q: "What position did Joseph receive?", options: ["Slave", "Second-in-command", "Priest", "Soldier"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 41:40" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Joseph's integrity shines in his refusal to sin against God. His statement 'How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?' shows he saw sin primarily as an offense against God. The pattern of Joseph being brought low and then exalted prefigures Christ's humiliation and exaltation."

  {
    id: 14,
    title: "Joseph and His Brothers",
    icon: "✨",
    era: "Patriarchs",
    summary: "The famine spread throughout the land. Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grain. The brothers didn't recognize Joseph, but he recognized them. Joseph tested them, keeping Simeon hostage until they brought Benjamin. After testing his brothers' hearts, Joseph finally revealed himself, weeping loudly. He forgave them, saying God sent him ahead to preserve life. The family was reunited, and Jacob moved to Egypt.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Genesis 45:4-5", text: "And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life." },
      { ref: "Genesis 50:20", text: "But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Who did Jacob refuse to send to Egypt at first?", options: ["Joseph", "Benjamin", "Reuben", "Judah"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 42:4" },
      { q: "How did Joseph view what his brothers did?", options: ["Pure evil", "An accident", "God's plan for good", "Unforgettable sin"], correct: 2, ref: "Genesis 50:20" },
      { q: "What did Joseph do when he revealed himself?", options: ["Punished them", "Forgave them", "Sent them away", "Ignored them"], correct: 1, ref: "Genesis 45:5" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Joseph's forgiveness is one of the most powerful examples in Scripture. His words 'You meant evil...but God meant it for good' show mature faith that trusts God's sovereignty. Romans 8:28 echoes Joseph's theology - God works all things for good for those who love Him."

    title: "Baby Moses",
    icon: "🍞",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "A new Pharaoh who didn't know Joseph enslaved the Israelites and ordered all Hebrew baby boys thrown into the Nile. A Levite woman hid her newborn son for three months, then placed him in a waterproof basket among the reeds. Pharaoh's daughter found the baby, took pity, and adopted him. The baby's sister arranged for their mother to nurse him. Pharaoh's daughter named him Moses, meaning 'drawn out.' Moses grew up in Pharaoh's palace as Egyptian royalty.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 2:3", text: "And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink." },
      { ref: "Exodus 2:10", text: "And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Why did Pharaoh order Hebrew baby boys killed?", options: ["They were criminals", "He feared their numbers", "A prophecy", "They were sick"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 1:9-10" },
      { q: "Who found baby Moses?", options: ["Pharaoh", "Pharaoh's daughter", "Moses' mother", "A servant"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 2:5" },
      { q: "What does 'Moses' mean?", options: ["Chosen one", "Drawn out", "Prince", "Saved"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 2:10" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "God's providence preserved Moses despite Pharaoh's genocide. The irony is profound - Pharaoh's daughter rescued and raised the very one who would deliver Israel from Pharaoh's hand. Moses' basket (ark) foreshadows Israel's salvation through the Red Sea and points to Christ, our ark of salvation."

  {
    id: 16,
    title: "The Burning Bush",
    icon: "🍷",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "Moses fled Egypt and became a shepherd in Midian. While tending his flock near Mount Horeb, Moses saw a bush burning but not consumed. God called to him from the bush, revealing Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God declared He would deliver His people from Egypt. Despite Moses' protests, God commanded him to go to Pharaoh. God promised, 'I AM WHO I AM' would be with him.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 3:4-5", text: "And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." },
      { ref: "Exodus 3:14", text: "And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What was unusual about the bush?", options: ["It was golden", "It burned but wasn't consumed", "It was huge", "It spoke"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 3:2" },
      { q: "What name did God reveal?", options: ["The Almighty", "I AM WHO I AM", "King of Kings", "The Lord"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 3:14" },
      { q: "What was Moses doing when God called him?", options: ["Praying", "Building", "Shepherding", "Farming"], correct: 2, ref: "Exodus 3:1" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "The name 'I AM WHO I AM' (Yahweh) emphasizes God's self-existence and unchanging nature. This is the name Jesus used in John 8:58, claiming deity. Moses' 40 years in the wilderness prepared him for leadership through humility and dependence on God."

  {
    id: 17,
    title: "The Ten Plagues",
    icon: "🌸",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "Moses appeared before Pharaoh demanding release of God's people. Pharaoh refused. God sent ten plagues: blood, frogs, gnats, flies, livestock disease, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and death of firstborn. After each plague, Pharaoh hardened his heart. Only after the final plague - when Pharaoh's own son died - did Pharaoh command Israel to leave.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 7:3-5", text: "And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments." },
      { ref: "Exodus 12:29-30", text: "And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How many plagues did God send?", options: ["7", "10", "12", "40"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 7-12" },
      { q: "What was the final plague?", options: ["Locusts", "Darkness", "Death of firstborn", "Hail"], correct: 2, ref: "Exodus 12:29" },
      { q: "What happened to Pharaoh's heart?", options: ["It softened", "It hardened", "It broke", "It changed"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 7:13" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "The plagues systematically dismantled Egypt's gods, declaring 'I am greater than all your gods.' The final plague introduces the Passover - the lamb's blood on doorposts foreshadows Christ's blood protecting believers from God's judgment."

    id: 18,
    title: "Crossing the Red Sea",
    icon: "💫",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "Pharaoh pursued Israel with his army. The Israelites were trapped at the Red Sea. Moses stretched out his staff, and all night a strong wind blew. The waters divided, creating a path on dry ground. Israel crossed safely. When the Egyptian army followed, the waters crashed down, drowning Pharaoh's entire army.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 14:13-14", text: "And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace." },
      { ref: "Exodus 14:21-22", text: "And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did Moses use to part the sea?", options: ["His staff", "His hands", "A sword", "His voice"], correct: 0, ref: "Exodus 14:16" },
      { q: "What happened to the Egyptian army?", options: ["They retreated", "They drowned", "They surrendered", "They escaped"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 14:28" },
      { q: "What did Moses tell the people?", options: ["Run", "Fight", "Stand still and see salvation", "Swim"], correct: 2, ref: "Exodus 14:13" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "The Red Sea crossing is one of Scripture's greatest displays of God's power. Paul uses it as a picture of baptism in 1 Corinthians 10:1-2. Moses' command to 'stand still' teaches that salvation is God's work, not ours."

  {
    id: 19,
    title: "The Ten Commandments",
    icon: "🌟",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "At Mount Sinai, God gave Moses the Law. The mountain shook with thunder, lightning, and trumpet blasts. God gave ten fundamental laws: worship no other gods, make no idols, don't misuse God's name, keep the Sabbath, honor parents, don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't lie, and don't covet. Moses wrote these on stone tablets.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 20:2-3", text: "I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me." },
      { ref: "Exodus 20:17", text: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Where did God give the Ten Commandments?", options: ["Mount Ararat", "Mount Sinai", "Mount Moriah", "Mount Nebo"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 19:20" },
      { q: "What is the first commandment?", options: ["Don't murder", "No other gods", "Don't steal", "Honor parents"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 20:3" },
      { q: "On what were they written?", options: ["Paper", "Wood", "Stone tablets", "Gold"], correct: 2, ref: "Exodus 31:18" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "The Ten Commandments reveal God's moral character. Jesus summarized all the Law as loving God and loving neighbor (Matthew 22:37-40). The Law shows God's holiness and our sinfulness (Romans 3:20), acting as a guardian to lead us to Christ (Galatians 3:24)."

    id: 20,
    title: "The Golden Calf",
    icon: "🕊️",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the people grew impatient. They convinced Aaron to make a god. Aaron fashioned a golden calf. The people worshiped it. God's anger burned, but Moses interceded. When Moses came down and saw the idol, he broke the stone tablets. He burned the calf and made the Israelites drink the ground powder. About 3,000 people died that day.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 32:4", text: "And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." },
      { ref: "Exodus 32:11-12", text: "And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?" }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What idol did the people make?", options: ["A snake", "A golden calf", "A statue", "A pillar"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 32:4" },
      { q: "Who made the golden calf?", options: ["Moses", "Aaron", "The people", "Joshua"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 32:4" },
      { q: "What did Moses do with the tablets?", options: ["Prayed", "Broke them", "Ran away", "Kept them"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 32:19" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Israel's golden calf happened almost immediately after receiving the command against idols. Aaron's weak leadership contrasts with Moses' bold intercession. Paul uses this as a warning against idolatry (1 Corinthians 10:7)."
