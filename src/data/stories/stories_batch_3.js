    title: "The Tabernacle",
    icon: "⛪",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "God gave Moses detailed instructions for building a portable sanctuary where He would dwell among His people. The Tabernacle had an outer court with bronze altar and basin, the Holy Place with lampstand, showbread table, and incense altar, and the Most Holy Place with the Ark of the Covenant. Only the High Priest could enter the Most Holy Place once yearly. When complete, God's glory filled the Tabernacle.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Exodus 25:8-9", text: "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it." },
      { ref: "Exodus 40:34", text: "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Why did God command the Tabernacle be built?", options: ["Storage", "To dwell among His people", "For meetings", "For safety"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 25:8" },
      { q: "What was in the Most Holy Place?", options: ["The altar", "The Ark of the Covenant", "The lampstand", "The showbread"], correct: 1, ref: "Exodus 26:33-34" },
      { q: "Who could enter the Most Holy Place?", options: ["Anyone", "All priests", "Only the High Priest", "Only Moses"], correct: 2, ref: "Leviticus 16:2" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "The Tabernacle points to Christ. The veil separating the Most Holy Place was torn when Christ died (Matthew 27:51), opening access to God. Hebrews explains how Christ fulfills everything the Tabernacle represented - He is our High Priest, sacrifice, and meeting place with God."

    title: "The 12 Spies",
    icon: "📖",
    era: "Exodus",
    summary: "At Canaan's border, Moses sent twelve spies to explore the land. They returned with fruit but ten spies reported giants and fortified cities. Only Caleb and Joshua urged trust in God. The people rejected their counsel and wanted to return to Egypt. God decreed that generation would wander 40 years in the wilderness until they died. Only Joshua and Caleb would enter the Promised Land.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Numbers 13:30-31", text: "And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we." },
      { ref: "Numbers 14:22-23", text: "Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How many spies were sent?", options: ["2", "10", "12", "40"], correct: 2, ref: "Numbers 13:2" },
      { q: "How many spies gave a good report?", options: ["None", "2", "10", "12"], correct: 1, ref: "Numbers 13:30, 14:6" },
      { q: "How long would Israel wander?", options: ["10 years", "20 years", "40 years", "70 years"], correct: 2, ref: "Numbers 14:33" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "This reveals the danger of unbelief despite seeing miracles. The ten spies saw circumstances instead of God's promises. Hebrews 3-4 uses this as a warning - unbelief keeps us from entering God's rest. Caleb and Joshua's faith saw obstacles through God's power."

    id: 23,
    title: "Joshua and Jericho",
    icon: "🎺",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "After Moses died, Joshua led Israel into Canaan. God gave unusual instructions for conquering Jericho: march around the city once daily for six days with seven priests carrying trumpets. On the seventh day, march seven times, blow trumpets, and shout. The walls collapsed. Israel captured the city, sparing only Rahab who had hidden the spies.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Joshua 6:2-5", text: "And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour... And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat." },
      { ref: "Joshua 6:20", text: "So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How many days did Israel march around Jericho?", options: ["1", "3", "7", "40"], correct: 2, ref: "Joshua 6:3-4" },
      { q: "What happened when the people shouted?", options: ["Nothing", "Rain fell", "The walls fell", "The enemy fled"], correct: 2, ref: "Joshua 6:20" },
      { q: "Who was spared in Jericho?", options: ["No one", "The king", "Rahab and her family", "The priests"], correct: 2, ref: "Joshua 6:25" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Jericho's conquest demonstrates that God's methods often defy human logic. The victory was entirely God's. Rahab's salvation shows God's grace extending to Canaanites who believed. She's in Jesus' genealogy (Matthew 1:5) and praised for faith (Hebrews 11:31)."

  {
    id: 24,
    title: "Gideon's Army",
    icon: "🌾",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "God called Gideon to deliver Israel from Midian. Gideon gathered 32,000 men, but God reduced the army to 300 so Israel wouldn't boast in their own strength. Armed only with trumpets, jars, and torches, they surrounded the Midianite camp at night. They broke jars, revealed torches, blew trumpets, and shouted. The Midianites panicked and fled.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Judges 7:2", text: "And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me." },
      { ref: "Judges 7:20-21", text: "And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How many men did Gideon originally gather?", options: ["300", "3,000", "10,000", "32,000"], correct: 3, ref: "Judges 7:3" },
      { q: "How many did God allow Gideon to keep?", options: ["100", "300", "1,000", "10,000"], correct: 1, ref: "Judges 7:7" },
      { q: "What weapons did they use?", options: ["Swords", "Trumpets and torches", "Bows", "Spears"], correct: 1, ref: "Judges 7:16" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Gideon's story shows God's power made perfect in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). By reducing the army, God ensured the glory would be His alone. This principle runs throughout Scripture: God uses the weak to shame the strong (1 Corinthians 1:27)."

  {
    id: 25,
    title: "Samson's Strength",
    icon: "🏔️",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "Samson was set apart as a Nazirite from birth with supernatural strength. He fought Philistines for 20 years, killing a lion barehanded and 1,000 Philistines with a jawbone. Delilah, bribed by Philistines, learned his strength came from uncut hair. She cut it while he slept. The Philistines captured and blinded him. When his hair grew back, God gave him strength one final time to destroy the temple, killing more Philistines in death than in life.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Judges 13:5", text: "For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines." },
      { ref: "Judges 16:28-30", text: "And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes... And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What was the source of Samson's strength?", options: ["His muscles", "His uncut hair", "His sword", "His faith"], correct: 1, ref: "Judges 16:17" },
      { q: "Who betrayed Samson?", options: ["His mother", "Delilah", "The Philistines", "His brother"], correct: 1, ref: "Judges 16:18" },
      { q: "How did Samson die?", options: ["In battle", "Old age", "Pulling down a temple", "Poisoned"], correct: 2, ref: "Judges 16:30" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Samson's story is a tragedy of wasted potential. Though blessed from birth, his moral weakness led to downfall. Yet Hebrews 11:32 lists him among the faithful, showing God's grace works through flawed people. His final prayer demonstrates repentance is possible after great failure."

  {
    id: 26,
    title: "Ruth and Naomi",
    icon: "🌟",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "Naomi's husband and sons died in Moab. Returning to Israel, she urged her daughters-in-law to stay. Ruth refused, declaring 'Where you go I will go.' In Bethlehem, Ruth gleaned in Boaz's fields. Boaz showed kindness and became their kinsman-redeemer, marrying Ruth. They had a son, Obed, who became King David's grandfather.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Ruth 1:16-17", text: "And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." },
      { ref: "Ruth 4:13-17", text: "So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife... And the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son... And they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did Ruth say to Naomi?", options: ["Goodbye", "Where you go I will go", "Stay in Moab", "I'll visit"], correct: 1, ref: "Ruth 1:16" },
      { q: "Who became Ruth's husband?", options: ["Elimelech", "Boaz", "Obed", "David"], correct: 1, ref: "Ruth 4:13" },
      { q: "Ruth was King David's what?", options: ["Mother", "Grandmother", "Great-grandmother", "Aunt"], correct: 2, ref: "Ruth 4:17" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Ruth beautifully illustrates redemption. Though a Gentile, Ruth became an ancestor of David and Jesus, demonstrating God's grace to all nations. Boaz as kinsman-redeemer pictures Christ who redeems us. The book shows God working through ordinary events to accomplish extraordinary purposes."

  {
    id: 27,
    title: "Samuel the Prophet",
    icon: "🔔",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "Hannah prayed for a son and vowed to dedicate him to God. God gave her Samuel. After weaning, she brought Samuel to Eli at the temple. As a boy, Samuel heard God call his name three times before Eli recognized it was the Lord. God revealed judgment on Eli's house. Samuel grew as a prophet, and all Israel recognized him as the Lord's prophet. He served as the last judge and anointed Israel's first two kings.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "1 Samuel 1:27-28", text: "For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD." },
      { ref: "1 Samuel 3:10", text: "And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Why did Hannah give Samuel to the temple?", options: ["She didn't want him", "She made a vow to God", "Eli demanded it", "It was the law"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Samuel 1:11" },
      { q: "What did Samuel hear God say?", options: ["His name", "Go to Egypt", "Fight", "Build a temple"], correct: 0, ref: "1 Samuel 3:4" },
      { q: "Who was Samuel's mentor?", options: ["Moses", "Joshua", "Eli", "Aaron"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Samuel 3:1" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Samuel's birth in answer to prayer shows the power of faithful parenting. His response 'Speak, for your servant hears' models attentiveness to God's voice. Samuel bridged judges and kings, maintaining prophetic ministry through Israel's transition. God spoke clearly to Samuel because he listened."
  },
  {
    id: 28,
    title: "King Saul",
    icon: "🎭",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "Israel demanded a king. God told Samuel to anoint Saul, an impressive young man. Initially humble, Saul started well with military victories. But pride and disobedience crept in. He offered unauthorized sacrifice and later spared the Amalekite king. Samuel declared, 'To obey is better than sacrifice.' God rejected Saul as king. An evil spirit tormented Saul, and jealousy of David consumed him until he died in battle.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "1 Samuel 15:22-23", text: "And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry." },
      { ref: "1 Samuel 16:14", text: "But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What tribe was Saul from?", options: ["Judah", "Benjamin", "Levi", "Dan"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Samuel 9:1-2" },
      { q: "Why did God reject Saul?", options: ["He was too tall", "He disobeyed", "He was sick", "He was poor"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Samuel 15:23" },
      { q: "What is better than sacrifice?", options: ["Prayer", "Fasting", "Obedience", "Worship"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Samuel 15:22" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Saul's reign illustrates starting well but finishing poorly. His outward qualifications couldn't compensate for inward deficiencies. Partial obedience is disobedience. The departure of God's Spirit was devastating. Saul's life warns against pride, making excuses, and valuing appearances over obedience."

  {
    id: 29,
    title: "David and Goliath",
    icon: "🌳",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "A giant named Goliath challenged Israel daily. The army cowered in fear. David, bringing food to his brothers, heard Goliath's taunts and volunteered to fight. Refusing Saul's armor, David took five stones and his sling. With one stone to Goliath's forehead, he dropped the giant and cut off his head with Goliath's own sword. The Philistines fled.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "1 Samuel 17:45-47", text: "Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied... And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD'S." },
      { ref: "1 Samuel 17:49-50", text: "And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead... So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How tall was Goliath?", options: ["6 feet", "7 feet", "Over 9 feet", "12 feet"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Samuel 17:4" },
      { q: "What weapons did David use?", options: ["Sword and shield", "Sling and stone", "Bow and arrow", "Spear"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Samuel 17:40" },
      { q: "What did David say the battle was?", options: ["Israel's", "His own", "The LORD's", "The army's"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Samuel 17:47" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "David's faith contrasts sharply with Saul's fear. While the army saw an unbeatable giant, David saw an enemy of God who would fall. His confidence came from past experiences of God's faithfulness. His declaration 'the battle is the Lord's' reveals the secret of victory."
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    title: "David Becomes King",
    icon: "🗝️",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "After Saul's death, David was anointed king of Judah. After civil war, all Israel recognized David as king at age 30. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital, bringing the Ark there. God made a covenant with David, promising his throne would be established forever. David's kingdom expanded. Though he sinned with Bathsheba, David was called a man after God's own heart because he genuinely sought the Lord and repented when confronted.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "2 Samuel 7:12-13", text: "And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever." },
      { ref: "Psalm 51:10-12", text: "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Where did David make his capital?", options: ["Bethlehem", "Hebron", "Jerusalem", "Samaria"], correct: 2, ref: "2 Samuel 5:7" },
      { q: "What did God promise David?", options: ["Great wealth", "An eternal throne", "Many sons", "A long life"], correct: 1, ref: "2 Samuel 7:13" },
      { q: "What was David called?", options: ["A warrior", "A man after God's heart", "A shepherd", "A poet"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Samuel 13:14" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "The Davidic covenant is foundational to understanding Jesus as Messiah. God's promise that David's throne would last forever finds fulfillment in Christ (Luke 1:32-33). David's heart for God is shown not in sinlessness but in genuine repentance and desire for restoration (Psalm 51)."
