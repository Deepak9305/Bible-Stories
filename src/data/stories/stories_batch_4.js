    title: "Solomon's Wisdom",
    icon: "⚖️",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "When David died, Solomon became king. God offered to give him whatever he asked. Solomon requested wisdom to govern well. This pleased God, who granted him unmatched wisdom plus riches and honor. Solomon's wisdom was demonstrated when two women claimed the same baby. Solomon called for a sword to divide the child. One agreed, but the true mother begged Solomon to give the baby to the other woman. Solomon identified the real mother by her compassion. He built the magnificent temple in Jerusalem.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "1 Kings 3:9-12", text: "Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad... And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing... Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee." },
      { ref: "1 Kings 4:29-30", text: "And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did Solomon ask God for?", options: ["Wealth", "Wisdom", "Long life", "Victory"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Kings 3:9" },
      { q: "How did Solomon identify the true mother?", options: ["DNA test", "By her compassion", "By questioning", "By size"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Kings 3:26-27" },
      { q: "What did Solomon build?", options: ["The tabernacle", "The temple", "A palace only", "A city"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Kings 6:1" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Solomon's request for wisdom pleased God because it showed proper priorities. James 1:5 promises God gives wisdom to all who ask. Solomon's wisdom wasn't merely intellectual but practical - ability to govern justly. His temple fulfilled David's desire to build God a house. Sadly, Solomon's foreign wives led his heart astray in later years (1 Kings 11)."

    title: "Elijah and the Ravens",
    icon: "🎨",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "King Ahab and Jezebel led Israel into Baal worship. Elijah declared there would be no rain except at his word. God told Elijah to hide by the Brook Cherith, where ravens brought him food morning and evening. When the brook dried, God sent him to a widow in Zarephath. Though she had only enough for one last meal, she obeyed Elijah's instruction to make him bread first. Miraculously, her flour and oil didn't run out. When her son died, Elijah prayed and God raised him to life.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "1 Kings 17:4-6", text: "And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD... And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening." },
      { ref: "1 Kings 17:14-16", text: "For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth... And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How did God feed Elijah by the brook?", options: ["Angels", "Ravens", "The widow", "Manna"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Kings 17:4" },
      { q: "What never ran out at the widow's house?", options: ["Water", "Bread", "Flour and oil", "Fish"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Kings 17:16" },
      { q: "What miracle did Elijah perform for the widow?", options: ["Healed her", "Raised her son", "Made it rain", "Multiplied money"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Kings 17:22" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "God's provision for Elijah using ravens (unclean birds) emphasizes God can use anything to accomplish His purposes. The widow's act of faith, giving her last food first, illustrates Matthew 6:33 - seek first God's kingdom and He'll provide. Her flour and oil never failing pictures God's endless supply to those who trust Him."

    title: "Mount Carmel Showdown",
    icon: "🌺",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "After three years of drought, Elijah confronted Ahab and challenged the people: 'How long will you waver? If the Lord is God, follow Him; if Baal, follow him.' On Mount Carmel, Elijah faced 450 prophets of Baal. Whichever god sent fire to consume the sacrifice would prove to be the true God. Baal's prophets called all day with no answer. Elijah drenched his altar with water three times, then prayed briefly. Fire from heaven consumed everything. The people declared, 'The Lord - He is God!' Elijah had the false prophets killed, then prayed and the rain returned.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "1 Kings 18:36-39", text: "And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel... Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice... And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "How many prophets of Baal did Elijah face?", options: ["100", "250", "450", "1000"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Kings 18:22" },
      { q: "What consumed Elijah's sacrifice?", options: ["Lightning", "Fire from heaven", "The priests", "Wind"], correct: 1, ref: "1 Kings 18:38" },
      { q: "What happened after the showdown?", options: ["Nothing", "Earthquake", "Rain came", "War began"], correct: 2, ref: "1 Kings 18:45" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "This confrontation revealed the Lord's supremacy over Baal. Elijah's challenge forced Israel to choose - they couldn't serve both God and idols. The fire consuming even stones and water demonstrated God's absolute power. Elijah's simple prayer contrasts with Baal's prophets' frantic efforts, showing true prayer's power comes from God."

    title: "Elisha's Miracles",
    icon: "📯",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "When Elijah was taken to heaven in a whirlwind, Elisha received a double portion of his spirit. Elisha performed many miracles: purified bad water, multiplied a widow's oil, raised a Shunammite woman's son, made an axe head float, and healed Naaman the Syrian of leprosy. When the Syrian army surrounded him, Elisha's servant panicked, but Elisha prayed his eyes would be opened. The servant saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire protecting them.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "2 Kings 2:9-10", text: "And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me." },
      { ref: "2 Kings 6:16-17", text: "And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see... and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did Elisha receive from Elijah?", options: ["His cloak only", "A double portion of his spirit", "Gold", "A staff"], correct: 1, ref: "2 Kings 2:9" },
      { q: "How was Naaman healed?", options: ["Prayer", "Medicine", "Washing in Jordan", "Sacrifice"], correct: 2, ref: "2 Kings 5:14" },
      { q: "What did Elisha's servant see?", options: ["Nothing", "Armies", "Horses and chariots of fire", "Angels only"], correct: 2, ref: "2 Kings 6:17" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Elisha's ministry shows God's concern for both nations and individuals. His double portion of Elijah's spirit was demonstrated by performing roughly twice as many recorded miracles. The vision of fiery chariots reminds us that spiritual realities surround us constantly, though unseen. Elisha's 50-year ministry brought God's power to both rich and poor."

    id: 35,
    title: "Jonah and the Fish",
    icon: "🛡️",
    era: "Kingdom",
    summary: "God commanded Jonah to preach to Nineveh (Israel's enemy). Jonah fled by ship. God sent a storm. Sailors threw Jonah overboard, and the sea calmed. God appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah. After three days and nights, the fish vomited Jonah onto land. God again commanded him to go to Nineveh. This time Jonah obeyed, preaching that Nineveh would be destroyed in 40 days. The entire city repented, from the king to the cattle, and God relented from destroying them.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Jonah 1:3", text: "But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD." },
      { ref: "Jonah 2:1-2", text: "Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice." },
      { ref: "Jonah 3:10", text: "And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "Why did Jonah run from God?", options: ["He was afraid", "He didn't want to go to Nineveh", "He was sick", "He forgot"], correct: 1, ref: "Jonah 1:2-3" },
      { q: "How long was Jonah in the fish?", options: ["1 day", "3 days and nights", "7 days", "40 days"], correct: 1, ref: "Jonah 1:17" },
      { q: "What happened when Jonah preached?", options: ["Nothing", "They mocked him", "They repented", "They killed him"], correct: 2, ref: "Jonah 3:5" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Jonah's story reveals God's mercy to the nations and the danger of prejudice. Jonah ran because he didn't want Nineveh spared. His three days in the fish prefigure Christ's three days in the tomb (Matthew 12:40). Nineveh's repentance shames Jonah and Israel for their hard hearts. The book ends emphasizing God's love for all nations."

  {
    id: 36,
    title: "Isaiah's Vision",
    icon: "🌙",
    era: "Captivity",
    summary: "In the year King Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted. Seraphim stood above Him calling, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.' Isaiah cried out, 'Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips.' A seraph touched Isaiah's lips with a live coal from the altar, purifying him. Then Isaiah heard God ask, 'Whom shall I send?' Isaiah responded, 'Here am I. Send me!' God commissioned him to prophesy to Israel.",
    scripture: [
      { ref: "Isaiah 6:3-5", text: "And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory... Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts." },
      { ref: "Isaiah 6:8", text: "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me." }
    ],
    questions: [
      { q: "What did the seraphim cry?", options: ["Hallelujah", "Holy, holy, holy", "Praise the Lord", "Glory to God"], correct: 1, ref: "Isaiah 6:3" },
      { q: "How was Isaiah purified?", options: ["Water", "Oil", "A coal from the altar", "Prayer"], correct: 2, ref: "Isaiah 6:6-7" },
      { q: "What was Isaiah's response to God's call?", options: ["I can't", "Send someone else", "Here am I, send me", "I'm afraid"], correct: 2, ref: "Isaiah 6:8" },
    ],
    studyNotes: "Isaiah's vision reveals God's holiness and majesty. The threefold 'Holy' emphasizes God's absolute purity. Isaiah's confession of sinfulness in God's presence shows that encountering God's holiness reveals our uncleanness. The coal from the altar represents God's cleansing, making Isaiah fit for service. His willing response 'Here am I' models readiness to serve God."
